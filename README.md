 The Data contains Three Datasets UserDetails, CookingSessions, and OrderDetails.
 By analyzing the relationship between three datasets I have showcased some insights and created some visualizations showing the order trends and user behaviour.
## Summary
After some analysis and insights I have found following business recommendations.
 1. We can say that Grilled chicken and spaghetti are the most popular dishes. so we need to improve the promotions
    and set some offers for the other dishes. So as the orders for other dishes may increase.
 2. Weekly order trend has been increased compared to first week. so we can say the order trend will increase in
    coming weeks.
 3. Locations like chicago, los angeles and new york have highest number of orders, so its better to increase some
    marketing and advertising procedures in other locations to improve the orders.
